The arguments presented in favor of strict laws to regulate LLMs are more convincing.

The proponents of strict laws clearly articulate significant potential harms stemming from unregulated LLMs, including the generation of misinformation at scale, privacy violations due to data requirements, and the potential for malicious applications like deepfakes or harassment. They argue that "strict laws" are necessary to enforce developer accountability, ensure testing for bias and accuracy, mandate transparency in data usage, and establish ethical guidelines. The urgency is emphasized by the rapid evolution of the technology. These arguments highlight concrete societal risks that require proactive and robust mitigation.

The arguments against strict laws, while raising valid concerns about stifling innovation, censorship, and creating barriers for smaller companies, do not offer a sufficiently strong counter-mechanism for preventing the harms identified by the proponents. The suggestion to rely on existing data privacy frameworks like GDPR is challenged by the unprecedented nature and scale of LLM capabilities, implying that current regulations may not be adequate. Furthermore, the argument that flexible guidelines are sufficient for ethical development is undermined by the potential for profit motives to override ethical considerations, which the proponents explicitly aim to counteract with regulation. While the risks of overregulation are real, the potential societal consequences of under-regulation as outlined by the proponents—particularly misinformation and privacy breaches—are presented as more immediate and severe threats that necessitate a stronger, more binding approach like strict laws to ensure accountability.
